# Udacity course

1. Want to write this in Kotlin, so forking and opening another Window in Android Studio makes the most sense.  This way, I can keep the original Udacity fork open and switch between branches to see new exercises without reloading the project (since adding Kotlin will change the build)

2. This also lets me version control my changes separately in a linear branch, since the Udacity project has each exercise in its own branch.  Also much easier to keep my Android Studio settings
